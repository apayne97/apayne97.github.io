I am a computational chemist with a deep background in biology and chemistry and a fascination with evolutionary biophysics who is interested in using models of protein-ligand interactions and protein dynamics to inform drug discovery. Through my work on antiviral drug discovery with the ASAP AViDD center, I have been learning how to critically assess a variety of computational chemistry approaches, including docking, structure-based machine-learning models, and free energy calculations. I am an inquisitive, enthusiastic team player excited to see others succeed. I am also passionate about education, with significant teaching, mentorship, and science outreach experience. My dream job is a joint position applying computational models to drug discovery and teaching biology and chemistry at a primarily undergraduate institution.
